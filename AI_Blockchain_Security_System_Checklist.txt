AI-Driven Blockchain-Backed Database Security System - Development Checklist

========================
1. AI Anomaly Detection Module
========================
[ ] Collect and preprocess SQL query logs
[ ] Implement Isolation Forest / Autoencoder for anomaly detection
[ ] Define threshold metrics and alert confidence scoring
[ ] Integrate AI model with SQL query stream (PostgreSQL + pgAudit)
[ ] Test model accuracy and latency (<2s)
[ ] Log AI decisions for retraining

========================
2. Blockchain Audit Logging
========================
[ ] Implement SHA-256 hashing of log data
[ ] Set up permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
[ ] Configure transaction and block writing policies
[ ] Build API to push and verify log hashes
[ ] Enable asynchronous blockchain commits

========================
3. Web Dashboard (Frontend + Backend)
========================
[ ] Design UI components for all modules
[ ] Implement authentication and role-based access
[ ] Add charts for alert frequency and model confidence
[ ] Connect Flask backend APIs to React frontend

========================
4. Security and Authentication
========================
[ ] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
[ ] Add JWT-based session management
[ ] Enforce HTTPS/TLS encryption
[ ] Encrypt sensitive fields with AES
[ ] Define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

========================
5. Database and API
========================
[ ] Create PostgreSQL tables (users, logs, anomalies, alerts)
[ ] Write APIs for CRUD operations and logging
[ ] Integrate AI model and blockchain modules with DB
[ ] Test data integrity and relationships

========================
6. Cloud & Deployment
========================
[ ] Containerize components with Docker
[ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions optional)
[ ] Host Flask + React on AWS
[ ] Secure environment variables and blockchain keys

========================
7. Monitoring, Compliance & Testing
========================
[ ] Integrate Grafana or ELK Stack
[ ] Test query latency and throughput
[ ] Ensure GDPR/HIPAA compliance
[ ] Conduct penetration and vulnerability testing

========================
8. Future Enhancements
========================
[ ] Upgrade to Transformer/LSTM models
[ ] Add explainability (SHAP/LIME)
[ ] Integrate with SIEM alerting systems
